>The question we asked was which direction is more effective. Is it
more effective to (a) solve one difficult problem accurately, or (b)
many simpler problems approximately. 

>我们探讨哪一个方向更有效。是(a)准确的解决一个困难的问题，还是(b)近似的解决更多简单的问题？

就像使用显式积分需要小步长，而隐式积分可以用更大的步长，但是计算每一个步长更加耗时。

>Since the work of Baraff
et al. [1998], the commonly accepted knowledge in the computer
graphics community has been to prefer large steps and implicit
methods for stiff problems.

共识是对于刚性问题，大的步长和隐式方法更好。

>However, in our studies we found that (b) is significantly more
effective than (a).

然而在我们的研究中，我们发现(b)比(a)要更加有效。
